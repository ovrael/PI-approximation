## General info

Program allows to estimate PI based on your number of randomly generated points.
[How it works?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/estimating-value-pi-using-monte-carlo/)

Using second method you will be asked to put number of rectangles to create. [How seconds method works?](https://www.wired.com/story/this-pi-day-calculate-the-value-of-pi-for-yourself/)

_I suggest not to put too big numbers with less than 8Gb RAM, max. 1 000 000._

## Status

Project is _expansionable_.

That means it is finished and I like how it works. But I am open to any issues connected to it (such as bug fix or adding new features in the long long future).

## Why did I create it

I was inspired by my friend who had to make similar program for studies. So I thought it would be great way to learn WinForms and here it is.
